# Exercise 1 - The Manual Menace
> A GitOps approach to perform and automate deployments.
## üë®‚Äçüç≥ Exercise Intro

In this exercise, we will use GitOps to set up our working environment. We will create Tenants with Tenant Operator and  set up dynamic environments `dev`, `test`, `preview` and `stage` in your SAAP Instance with Tronador.  We will also explore the tools like ArgoCD, Tekton, Helm and Nexus to enable CI/CD/CT in the next exercise. We will learn how tools such as CodeReady Workspaces and Mattermost enable collaboration with developers, and how we can store our secrets safely with Vault and access them using External Secrets. In order to do all this, we'll use a popular approach called _GitOps_

## üî® Tools used in this exercise

* <span style="color:blue;">[Helm](https://helm.sh/)</span> - Helps us to define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes application.
* <span style="color:blue;">[ArgoCD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/)</span> - A controller which continuously monitors application and compare the current state against the desired
* <span style="color:blue;">[Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/nexus-repository-sonatype)</span> - Repository manager for storing lots of application types. Can also host `npm` and `Docker` registries.
* <span style="color:blue;">[Tekton](https://tekton.dev/)</span> - Tekton is a powerful and flexible open-source framework for creating CI/CD systems, allowing developers to build, test, and deploy across cloud providers and on-premise systems.
* <span style="color:blue;">[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)</span> - Secure, store and tightly control access to tokens, passwords, certificates, encryption keys for protecting secrets and other sensitive data using a UI, CLI, or HTTP API.
* <span style="color:blue;">[External Secret](https://external-secrets.io/)</span> - Kubernetes operator that integrates external secret management systems like AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Google Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault and many more. The operator reads information from external APIs and automatically injects the values into a Kubernetes Secret.
* <span style="color:blue;">[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/)</span> - GitLab helps you automate the builds, integration, and verification of your code
* <span style="color:blue;">[Tenant Operator](https://docs.cloud.stakater.com/content/sre/tenant-operator/overview.html)</span> - uses namespaces as independent sandboxes, where tenant applications can run independently of each other
* <span style="color:blue;">[Nexus](https://www.sonatype.com/products/nexus-repository)</span> - Manage binaries and build artifacts across your
software supply chain.
* <span style="color:blue;">[Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/)</span> - an open source platform for developer collaboration
* <span style="color:blue;">[Forecastle](https://github.com/stakater/Forecastle)</span> - Forecastle is a control panel which dynamically discovers and provides a launchpad to access applications deployed on Kubernetes
* <span style="color:blue;">[CodeReady Workspaces](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/codeready-workspaces)</span> - CodeReady Workspaces provides developer workspaces with everything needed to a code, build, test, run, and debug applications
* <span style="color:blue;">[Tronador](https://github.com/stakater/tronador)</span> - Trondador enables teams to have separate isolated testing environments per project easily in declarative way and enables multiple teams to collaborate on complex application stacks respecting their own revisions.
