# 🐭 Vault 101

Keeping your application configurations separate from your container instances can be advantageous for improving its flexibility and reducing overall engineering overhead.

[Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) are objects which contain sensitive data. These sensitive data can be passwords, keys, tokens, etc., and are created independently of your applications. They are used in your applications as environment variables or volumes. 

[Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs) is an identity-based secret and encryption management system. It is an open-source tool which provides a secure, reliable way to store and distribute secrets, as well as encrypt data.

Vault uses the concept of `Secret Engines` to manage sensitive data. Secrets Engines are components that store, generate, or encrypt data. When provided with data, they take some action on it and depending on the kind of engine, return a result.
