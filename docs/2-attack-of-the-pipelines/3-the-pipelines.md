## Pipelines

Why create pipelines:

* Assurance - drive up code quality and remove the need for dedicated deployment / release management teams
* Freedom - allow developers to take ownership of how and when code gets built and shipped
* Reliability - pipelines are a bit boring; they execute the same way each and every time they're run!
* A pathway to production:
  * Puts the product in the hands of the customer quicker
  * Enables seamless and repeatable deploys
  * More prod like infrastructure increases assurance
  * “We have already done it” behavior de-risks go live

### Pre-requisites

* Team/Participant tenant added to the cluster.
* Running version of Nordmart review and Nordmart review UI deployed through the cluster.
